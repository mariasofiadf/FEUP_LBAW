# PA: Product and Presentation

This project consists in an auction website for antiques, that being works of art, books, furniture, jewelry and more.

## A9: Product

The majority of auctions, taken in person, causes a huge number of inconviniences, such as the weight of the objects to carry or its carefull manouvre, such as to not accidentally make it loose its value. As such, just being present carries a number of extra costs that could be absolutely avoidable or mitigated

That is the focus behind our product. Our platform presents an easy and conveninet way of bidding or auctioning off valuable articles, in absolute confort.

Our platforms design is rather intuitive, whereby the average user will see no problem utilising it, making his experience that much more enjoyable.
