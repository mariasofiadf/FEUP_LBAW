## A1: Hand of Midas

> Goals, business context and environment.  
> Motivation.  
> Main features.  
> User profiles.

The main goal of the Hand of Midas project is to provide a web based service, where its users are able to buy and/or sell a variety of items of rare characteristics, through online auctions, namely art pieces, decór items, books and jewelry. As the name states, this website encourages the community to increase the added value of such items. The market of rare artifacts is not usually easy to enter, you must know how each community works and lose a lot of time searching for the right item or the right seller, and sometimes the auctions can be private or invitation-only. Hand of Midas seeks to create a more democratic process for interested parties, allowing them to bid on and sell in online auctions for exclusive artifacts in an easy, simple way. 

This website can be used by collectors, enthusiasts and sellers to find and sell unique items. The users need to be authenticated in order to bid on an existing auction, put up an item for sale and manage its auction or even follow auctions they are interested in. An Authenticated User has access to a private dashboard, where they are able to see their bidding and selling history. There’s also an Administrator user group with broader permissions so they can manage all auctions and reports but also edit the categories in which the items are divided in. However, any Non-Authenticated User is able to see the active auctions, view other user profiles and search products by category, starting price, auction ending time and others.

The website will have a responsive design, which allows users to access it from a different range of devices such as smartphones, computers and tablets. Its main goal is to provide an easy and enjoyable experience for both bidders or sellers, and especially regarding browsing auctions and products.
