    <p> This website was created with academic purposes in mind, by the 3rd group in class 2 of the LBAW course, during the 1st semester of
        the lective year of 2021/2022. The site's founding members are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Afonso Duarte de Carvalho Monteiro (up201907284)</li>
        <li>Ana Rita Antunes Ramada (up201904565)</li>
        <li>Deborah Marques Lago (up201806102)</li>
        <li>Maria Sofia Diogo Figueiredo (up201904675)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p> In its conception, the idea was to incorporate what was learned during classes in a concrete project, 
        following one theme out of a pool of them available. In our group's case, it was decided to create an auction website.</p>
